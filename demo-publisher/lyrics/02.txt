Free Love

In the realm of code, our hearts compile,
Open source affection, our love versatile.
No proprietary walls, just freedom's embrace,
In this software of love, you're my open space.

No licenses needed, just passion so free,
Our hearts synchronize, like open-source glee.
You're the GPL to my heart's source,
In this love's repository, our connection stays on course.
