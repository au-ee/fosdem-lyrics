Code Comedy Café

Coffee stains on my code, a morning brew,
Syntax errors play peek-a-boo.
Penguin's wisdom, a coder's jest,
Compiler whispers, put it to the test.

Bugs and glitches, a comedy array,
In the coding café, laughter at play.
Penguin claims a feature, not a flaw,
In the open source comedy, coding's the law.

In this caffeinated coding spree,
A debugging stand-up, humor is key.
