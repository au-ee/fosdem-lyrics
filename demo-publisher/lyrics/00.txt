Free Flow

In the binary dance of love, our hearts sync,
Open-source whispers, in code, we link.
No restrictions, just freedom's sweet call,
In this shared codebase, we stand tall.

Your love's the license to my soul's repository,
No proprietary barriers, just open-source glory.
Our romance compiles, error-free,
In the language of love, forever, you and me.
