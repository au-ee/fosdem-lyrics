Code Comedy Safari

Debugging antics, a photon pony's race,
Penguin's advice, a smile on its face.
Compiler owl asks, I hear a bark,
In code jungles, a chimpanzee sparks.

Bugs in a tango, with a kangaroo's hop,
In the coding savannah, a giraffe on top.
Penguin swears, it's a feature, not a flaw,
In the open source circus, coding's the law.

In this laughter safari, animals play,
A debugging bonanza, in a coding array.
