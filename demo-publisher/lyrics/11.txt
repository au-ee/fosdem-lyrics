Libre Bash Boogie

Open source beats echoing, code is the sound,
GNU groove spreading, freedom all around.
GPL dance party, where licenses shine,
Linux rhythm flowing, in lines of design.

Free software tunes, a melody so clear,
In the code we trust, no proprietary fear.
Collaboration celebration, a dance so grand,
Raise a glass to freedom, united we stand.
