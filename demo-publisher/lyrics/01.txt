Libre Love

In the lines of code, our hearts entwine,
Free as the software, your love is mine.
No restrictions bind, just an open-source flow,
In this digital dance, our emotions grow.

Like an unlicensed dream, our love takes flight,
No proprietary secrets, just passion so bright.
You're the GNU of my heart, forever free,
In this shared codebase, it's you and me.
