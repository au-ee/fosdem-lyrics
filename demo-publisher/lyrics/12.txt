Open Code Carnival

Freedom flows in lines of code,
Open source beats, a celebration mode.
GPL dance vibes, licenses in play,
Linux rhythm pulsing, all night and day.

Free software melodies, echoing free,
In the coding realm, where minds roam free.
Collaboration party, a dance so grand,
Raise a toast to freedom, across the land.
