Libre Serenade

In the realm of zeros and ones, our love unfolds,
Free software emotions, a story yet untold.
No constraints bind us, just a limitless sky,
In this open-source love, you and I.

Your touch, an API, unlocking my heart,
No closed-source doubts, we'll never part.
In this code of affection, where binaries blend,
Our love, a syntax that will never end.
