Freedom Beats Fiesta

Open source rhythms, code in the air,
GNU vibes swirling, freedom to declare.
GPL dance floor, where licenses play,
Linux beats grooving, all night and day.

Free software melodies, harmonies align,
In the world of code, our spirits entwine.
Collaboration celebration, a party so grand,
Raise a toast to the penguin, dancing hand in hand.
