Let's Party Like It's Open Source

In the code of the night, let's party like it's open source,
No closed doors, just dancing without remorse.
GitHub DJ spinning beats, commits in the air,
Pull requests for fun, no bugs to repair.

Raise your glasses, toast to the freedom we adore,
No proprietary tunes, just laughter galore.
In this party of pixels, where software meets fun,
Our celebration compiles, and the night has begun!
