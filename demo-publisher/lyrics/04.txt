Freedom's Harmony

In the symphony of open code, our love finds its song,
Free as the software, our hearts belong.
No licenses constrain the melody we create,
In this open-source love, we celebrate.

Your love, an algorithm, perfectly designed,
No proprietary boundaries, just passion entwined.
In this shared repository of dreams and delight,
Our love compiles, an eternal byte.
